# Divide and conquer

It is a strategy for solving problems. If a problem of size `n` and it is large you can divide it into `k` small sub-problems. 
Solve sub-problems separately and combine them to get the solution for main problem. If sub-problems, divide it again and again 
until it is easily solved.


The sub-problems should be the same as main problem, for instance if the main problem is sorting the sub-problems should be 
sorting as well. If task are different for each sub-problems then it is not divide-and-conquer. This strategy is recursive in nature.
You also need some solution to combine the solution from sub-problems, if you can't find a solution, you can not use divide-and-conquer
strategy.

Example of problems thatg can be solved with divide and conquer:
1) Binary Search.  
2) Finding Max/ Min.  
3) Merge Sort.  
4) Quick Sort.  
5) Strassen Matrix Multiplication.
