# Greedy Algorithms

A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making at each point the locally optimal choice 
in order to find a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy typically does not provide an optimal solution, but a greedy 
heuristic may generate locally optimal solutions in a reasonable amount that approximates a globally optimal solution.

Greedy is an algorithmic method that constructs a piece by piece solution, always selecting the next piece that provides the most 
apparent and immediate benefit. So the problems where the locally optimal option often leads to a global solution are best suited for Greedy.


Strategies for solving optimisation problem:
1) Greedy method.
2) Dynamic Programming.
3) Branch and Bound.


greedy algorithms have five components:

A candidate set, from which a solution is created
A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution
A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution
An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution, and
A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution
