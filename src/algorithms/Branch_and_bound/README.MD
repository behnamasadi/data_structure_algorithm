# Branch and Bound
In this approach, which is generally used for solving combinatorial optimization problems we use BFS traverse to create the **state space tree**. 
it is useful for solving optimization problem (only minimization problem).


## Example 1: Job Sequence Problem

## Example 2: 0/1 Knapsack problem
